# ASWF Project Build Utilities

This repo is a collection of documentation, samples, macros, and other
utilities for setting up projects.

This includes a special focus on supporting rules to build components
within the [VFX Reference Platform](http://vfxplatform.com).

This effort has been chosen to focus primarily on support for cmake,
but other contributions are welcome.
