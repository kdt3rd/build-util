# ASWF Project Build Utilities

This folder contains a sample library using the ASWF cmake macros.

It can be used as a template for copying and making your own library
using these macros to setup and declare the compile components of a
library.

Documentation about why settings are in the files is contained in the
CMakeLists.txt files

To see it run (or test that it runs), you can use the Makefile at the
top level if running under a platform with GNU make and cmake
available on the command line. Otherwise, do the "normal" cmake
process of creating a build folder, run cmake or cmake-gui, pointing
at this folder.
